      <p>I am a big believer in lifetime learning.</p>
      <p>
        I live in northern NJ, in a suburb far from “the Shore” but not too
        close to “the City”, with my partner Shawn and our 4 cats.

        I play a lot of ball hockey (aka floor hockey aka dek hockey aka boot
        hockey…), and some golf and soccer. When I’m not obsessing over my cats,
        I obsess over food and books and bullet journals.

        My career path is a bit unconventional. With a BA in Communications and
        no idea what to do, I stumbled into Accounting for my first ~7
        professional years. I went back to school for an Accounting degree while
        working full-time, and with one course left, I pivoted into project
        management and then web development (still finished the Accounting
        degree).

        Fast forward to now, I’m a software engineer at Honeycomb.io since June
        2021, and often wonder how I ever had a career doing anything else. This
        stuff is fun! (and frustrating as all heck, but rarely boring)
